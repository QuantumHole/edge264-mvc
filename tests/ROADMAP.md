# Test roadmap

Implemented tests carry a file name, the rest are planned.

edge264-mvc's own tests - MVC conformance, real-world decode robustness, memory safety and multithreading - live in [`tests/conformance`](conformance), [`tests/liveness`](liveness) and [`tests/asan`](asan) (described in the [README](../README.md#tests)) and run under `make check`. The synthetic per-branch matrix below is the original edge264's roadmap; edge264-mvc has begun filling in the MVC rows it has fixtures for (see [`tests/conformance/mvc-synthetic`](conformance/mvc-synthetic)).
